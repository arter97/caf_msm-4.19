/* controller details
 *
 *  It has 32 FIFOs (of up to 32 CAN-frames).
 *
 * There are 4 Fifo types which can get configured:
 * * TEF - Transmission Event Fifo - which consumes FIFO 0
 *   even if it is not configured
 * * Tansmission Queue - for up to 32 Frames.
 *   this queue reorders CAN frames to get transmitted following the
 *   typical CAN dominant/recessive rules on the can bus itself.
 *   This FIFO is optional.
 * * TX FIFO: generic TX fifos that can contain arbitrary data
 *   and which come with a configurable priority for transmission
 *   It is also possible to have the Controller automatically trigger
 *   a transfer when a Filter Rule for a RTR frame matches.
 *   Each of these fifos in principle can get configured for distinct
 *   dlc sizes (8 thru 64 bytes)
 * * RX FIFO: generic RX fifo which is filled via filter-rules.
 *   Each of these fifos in principle can get configured for distinct
 *   dlc sizes (8 thru 64 bytes)
 *   Unfortunately there is no filter rule that would allow triggering
 *   on different frame sizes, so for all practical purposes the
 *   RX fifos have to be of the same size (unless one wants to experience
 *   lost data).
 * When a Can Frame is transmitted from the TX Queue or an individual
 * TX FIFO then a small TEF Frame can get added to the TEF FIFO queue
 * to log the Transmission of the frame - this includes ID, Flags
 * (including a custom identifier/index) and the timestamp (see below).
 *
 * The controller provides an optional free running counter with a divider
 * for timestamping of RX frames as well as for TEF entries.

/* Implementation notes:
 *
 * Right now we only use the CAN controller block to put us into deep sleep
 * this means that the oscillator clock is turned off.
 * So this is the only thing that we implement here right now
